I was diagnosed with T1 diabetes all the way back in 2012. It's been a constant in my life ever since, interfering no more than necessary. Shifting from spot finger-pricks to continuous monitoring of interstital glucose has made this process far more comfortable and informed. In the following study, Hrishi Olickel and I discuss the clinical use and inside workings of my Freestyle Libre, then develop our own tools for oversight and analytics.
