excerpt: "One of the biggest problems for new progrmming languages is to get them to run well across different platforms. In my Capstone project, I explore one way of doing that for Lift, a new ML-targeted language by converting programs into Cyclo Static Dataflow Graphs. These graphs can then be analyzed and improved for execution efficiency."
