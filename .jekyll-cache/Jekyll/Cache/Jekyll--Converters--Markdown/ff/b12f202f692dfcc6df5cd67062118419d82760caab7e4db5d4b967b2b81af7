I"¼<p>During my last bout with insomnia I decided I wanted to get a bit more familiar with pythonâ€™s <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions">regex</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and <a href="https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PRAW Reddit API</a> all at the same time. This turned into an exploratory saga into <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/text-mining-101-topic-modeling.html">topic modelling</a>, a fascinating subset of natural language processing that uncovers common topics within text data. As a random mini-task, Iâ€™d decided to try mining new r/news posts to find current popular topics, then return matching articles.</p>
