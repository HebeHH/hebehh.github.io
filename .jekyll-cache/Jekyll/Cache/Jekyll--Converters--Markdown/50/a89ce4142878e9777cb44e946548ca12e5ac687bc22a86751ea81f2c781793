<p>Iâ€™m currently in my third year of undergrad at Yale-NUS College studying Computer Science, which ends up being a wandering chain of disparate tech courses interspersed with the odd humanities. I like OCaml for theoretical constructions, Pythonâ€™s Jupyter for practical math, and Brainfuck for late nights with alcohol.</p>

<p>Last Christmas saw me road tripping through NZâ€™s South Island on my new motorbiking, Basyl, with gorgeous sun and a slew of hail. Iâ€™ve devoured Terry Pratchett, adore Asimovâ€™s grandiose great-man narratives, and been properly drawn into Neal Stephensonâ€™s intricate detailing.</p>
