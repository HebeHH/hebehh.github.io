### Hi, I'm Hebe.


![image-20180802044440376]({{github.hebehh.io}}/assets/motorbikenice.jpg)

I'm currently in my third year of undergrad at Yale-NUS College studying Computer Science, which ends up being a wandering chain of disparate tech courses interspersed with the odd humanities. I like OCaml for theoretical constructions, Python's Jupyter for practical math, and Brainfuck for late nights with alcohol.

Last Christmas saw me road tripping through NZ's South Island on my new motorbiking, Basyl, with gorgeous sun and a slew of hail. I've devoured Terry Pratchett, adore Asimov's grandiose great-man narratives, and been properly drawn into Neal Stephenson's intricate detailing.
